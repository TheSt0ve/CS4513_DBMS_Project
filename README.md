# Overview
Created in Fall 2022, this was a class project for CS/DSA 4513 (Database Management Systems) at OU.

If you plan to take inspiration from this project, please keep in mind that nearly all schools have ways of detecting academic misconduct through file comparison. 

That being said, I'm quite proud of this project as a way of demonstrating my proficiency with SQL.
